<title>Brainstorm for Website Creation</title>
</head>

<h1>Planning Site</h1>
<p>Smart Objectives</p>
<li>For my client, i.e. Salesman, to prmote his jewllery through a efficient as simple manner, with a factor that makes the website easy to navigate through .</li>
<h1>Brainstorm</h1>
<p>Ideas for websites to create</p>
<ul>
  <li>A tutorial on HTML and CSS coding site</li>
  <li>A booking service that can set a time and date</li>
  <li>A website that can add notes as well as organize your daily schdule: which catagorizes important event from unimportant</li>
  <li>A website that can see the amount of money you have spent that can document the total pocket money avaliable and spent</li>
  <li>A website that can help with time management and organization</li>
  <li>An online documentor that can help you set deadlines </li>
</ul>
<h1>A website that can be a solution to peoples spending problems</h1>
<p>For example, I have a friend and he has a spending problem, where in he spends
  more than he can afford to spend. This brings him at a loss in total money he
  has. This website could be a documenting base where in he inserts a value and a
  goal, If he spends more than the total value entered, he has multiple warnings
  to reduce. So in this way, he can resolve his spending issues, as well as having
  self knowledge of how much money he actually has</P>
  <ul>
    <li>This could resolve the issue of overspending by a easy document UI</li>
    <li>This could help resolve the issue of organization, One might ask "How
      about using a spreadsheet to document a persons spending"But this could resolve
      the issue of misplacing a spreadsheet or the lack of access.</li>
    </ul>
      <h1>A website that can help beginners with CSS and HTML coding.</h1>
      <p>For example, This website could help me put down my thoughts and ideals
        about the basics of CSS and HTML, coding using simple ideologies, that people
        who are new to coding, can get familiar to the content.</P>
        <ul>
          <li>This could help resolve the issue of learning a new language such as HTML, this
            could help the students in the class, refrer back to the website to learn
            skills that we have learnt in class. This site could cover the content on what
            we have learnt so far, this could be a useful documenting base.</li>
            <li> Some people might say, "Why not codeacedemy", This website has the information
              on what we have learnt so far, it is easier to learn in from a student produced
              site, this will have familar concepts of learning that will click into peoples heads
              with ease. And thus, it will be easier to use.
              <li>This website could be helpful when students want to improve their
                e portfolio section, It could be a website on the basis of coding</li>
<h1>"The Magia Project</h1>
            <h1>Objectives</h1>
            <ul>For: My Client, To: Convey his work through a website, in which his audience is his clients</ul>
            <ul>For: My Client, To: Convey his work through a website, in which his audience is his clients, that can view his work on the internet</ul>
            <ul>For: My Client, To: Convey his work through a website, in which his audience is his clients, that can view his work on the internet in a organized manner, in which there are different subheadings</ul>
            <ul> For: My Client, To: Convey his work through a website, in which his audience is his client(s), that are focused on selling his jewllery to unreachable markets, in order to sell his products, he needs a website to reach the unavalibale markets as well as attract a wider array of his audience </ul>
            <h1>MAP'S</h1>
            <ul>Message: "Magia", the jewllery company, to as a result display products, through the internet</ul>
            <ul>Audience: The overall clients for the Company Magia, are the Clients, the people who either buy the products of my client, or sell it to others to buy the products</ul>
            <ul>Purpose: The overall purpose of this website, is to actively convey, Magia's products through the website, In primary focus to, display the jewllery to unreachable markets, and the sidebenefit is that we can, display the products to current clients to mt client</ul>
                  </ul>
                  <p> The Idea for creating a website, is helping my parents build
                    a jewllery website for their specific clients. This can be a document
                    base for showing their current clients and not for intentionally
                    attracting new clients</p>
<h1>Notes from Peers</h1>
<p>"Why don't you put your contact us page, as well as about us page combine into one page?"</p>
<p>This is a good idea, because I can even make a sublink to the "Shows we attend" page, redcuing the number of pages in total, therefore making the site a whole lot simpler.</p>
<h1>Wireframe, development into Storyboard</h1>

<h2>Interview from Parents</h2>
<h1>Wireframe, Barebones Version</h1>
<img src="Wireframe Draft.png" width="500px"/>
<p>This was the first interview, I had with my client. In simple terms my client wanted a simple
  functioning site for his Jewllery company, "Magia", that will show his clients his products, in a way to organize the products in sections
  such as: bracelets, rings, necklaces as well as earrings</p>
<p>This was the second interview, I had with my client, I told him the progress we were at, I showed my client
  the flowcharts, but he is not know what to expect, I told him that I will show him the "wirefame", in a weeks time</p>
<p>This was the third interview with my client, this was a interview, I asked him the question. "What are the products, that you want to display on the website?". My client said
  I will send you a few photos of the merchandise we have, as well with those images catagorize them.</p.
<p>This was the fourth interview, I had with my client, such as in this interview I told my client about the idea that a peer gave me in class, "Why don't you put your contact us page, as well as about us page combine into one page?",
This is a good idea, because I can even make a sublink to the "Shows we attend" page, redcuing the number of pages in total, therefore making the site a whole lot simpler. My client liked this idea as well</p>

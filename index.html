<h1>Brainstorm</h1>
<p>Ideas for websites to create</p>
<ul>
  <li>A tutorial on HTML and CSS coding site</li>
  <li>A booking service that can set a time and date</li>
  <li>A website that can add notes as well as organize your daily schdule: which catagorizes important event from unimportant</li>
  <li>A website that can see the amount of money you have spent that can document the total pocket money avaliable and spent</li>
  <li>A website that can help with time management and organization</li>
  <li>An online documentor that can help you set deadlines </li>
</ul>
<h1>A website that can be a solution to peoples spending problems</h1>
<p>For example, I have a friend and he has a spending problem, where in he spends
  more than he can afford to spend. This brings him at a loss in total money he
  has. This website could be a documenting base where in he inserts a value and a
  goal, If he spends more than the total value entered, he has multiple warnings
  to reduce. So in this way, he can resolve his spending issues, as well as having
  self knowledge of how much money he actually has</P>
  <ul>
    <li>This could resolve the issue of overspending by a easy document UI</li>
    <li>This could help resolve the issue of organization, One might ask "How
      about using a spreadsheet to document a persons spending"But this could resolve
      the issue of misplacing a spreadsheet or the lack of access.</li>
    </ul>
      <h1>A website that can help beginners with CSS and HTML coding.</h1>
      <p>For example, This website could help me put down my thoughts and ideals
        about the basics of CSS and HTML, coding using simple ideologies, that people
        who are new to coding, can get familiar to the content.</P>
        <ul>
          <li>This could help resolve the issue of learning a new language such as HTML, this
            could help the students in the class, refrer back to the website to learn
            skills that we have learnt in class. This site could cover the content on what
            we have learnt so far, this could be a useful documenting base.</li>
            <li> Some people might say, "Why not codeacedemy", This website has the information
              on what we have learnt so far, it is easier to learn in from a student produced
              site, this will have familar concepts of learning that will click into peoples heads
              with ease. And thus, it will be easier to use.
              <li>This website could be helpful when students want to improve their
                e portfolio section, It could be a website on the basis of coding</li>
              </ul>
